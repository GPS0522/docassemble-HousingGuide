GUIDE ME: I live in subsidized or public housing and I don't think I am
paying the right rent and I have informed my worker or property manager
that I lost income and I have heard nothing further.

**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of assistance.**

******Be Proactive:**

If you have not heard back from your worker or property manager, the
first thing you should do is be proactive and call. Make sure you write
down the time and date you called and whether you spoke to someone or
left a voicemail. If you spoke to someone, make sure you write down
their name and what you spoke about.

** Make sure that you told your worker or property manager
about your reduced income in writing:**

Sometimes worker or property managers forget the details of a call or
in-person conversation. That is why it is really important that you send
them a message in writing giving them notice that your income has gone
down. Do this as soon as possible. Date and keep copies of this written
notice. This will create proof if there is a dispute about when you gave
notice. In most cases, your rent will get lowered as of the first month
after you give your worker or property manager notice.
