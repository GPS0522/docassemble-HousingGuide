GUIDE ME: I live in subsidized or public housing and I don't think I am
paying the right rent and my worker or property manager is asking me for
verifications that I can't get.

**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of assistance.**

**** I**f the loss of income is because you lost your job or
some benefits:**

Call your worker or property manager and ask for help. If the loss of
income is because you lost your job or some benefits, your worker or
property manager should be verifying this for you. Your worker or
property manager should have had you sign a form that allows your worker
or property manager to get this information directly from your employer
or government program.

** If the loss of income is because someone moved out:**

Call your worker or property manager and ask for help. If the loss of
income is because someone moved out, the worker will ask you for
verification of where that person moved to. If that person is not
cooperating with you, tell your worker in writing you can't get it. Ask
the worker about alternative ways to verify that someone has left. It
may be possible to get the worker to accept a signed statement from you
that the person has moved out.
