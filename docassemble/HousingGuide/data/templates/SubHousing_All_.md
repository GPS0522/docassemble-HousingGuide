GUIDE ME: I live in subsidized or public housing and I don't think I am
paying the right rent and I have informed my worker or property manager
that I lost income and I have heard nothing further.



**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of
assistance.**



******Be Proactive:**



If you have not heard back from your worker or property manager, the
first thing you should do is be proactive and call. Make sure you write
down the time and date you called and whether you spoke to someone or
left a voicemail. If you spoke to someone, make sure you write down
their name and what you spoke about.



** Make sure that you told your worker or property manager
about your reduced income in writing:**



Sometimes worker or property managers forget the details of a call or
in-person conversation. That is why it is really important that you send
them a message in writing giving them notice that your income has gone
down. Do this as soon as possible. Date and keep copies of this written
notice. This will create proof if there is a dispute about when you gave
notice. In most cases, your rent will get lowered as of the first month
after you give your worker or property manager notice.

GUIDE ME: I live in subsidized or public housing and I don't think I am
paying the right rent and my worker or property manager is asking me for
verifications that I can't get.



**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of
assistance.**



**** I**f the loss of income is because you lost your job or
some benefits: **



Call your worker or property manager and ask for help. If the loss of
income is because you lost your job or some benefits, your worker or
property manager should be verifying this for you. Your worker or
property manager should have had you sign a form that allows your worker
or property manager to get this information directly from your employer
or government program.



** If the loss of income is because someone moved
out:**



Call your worker or property manager and ask for help. If the loss of
income is because someone moved out, the worker will ask you for
verification of where that person moved to. If that person is not
cooperating with you, tell your worker in writing you can't get it. Ask
the worker about alternative ways to verify that someone has left. It
may be possible to get the worker to accept a signed statement from you
that the person has moved out.

GUIDE ME: I live in subsidized or public housing and I don't think I am
paying the right rent and my worker or property manager has sent me a
notice stating my new rent and I don't think it is correct.



**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of
assistance.**



** If You Live in Public Housing or Have a Mobile Section 8
Voucher:**



Ask for a meeting with your worker or property manager. If you live in
public housing or have a mobile Section 8 voucher, you have the right to
request an informal hearing or grievance if you think your rent is
wrong. This should have been stated in your rent change
notice.



** If You Live in Private Subsidized Housing:**



Ask for a meeting with your worker or property manager. If you live in
private subsidized housing, you do not have a right to a hearing or
grievance but the landlord is still required to consult with you if you
think a mistake has been made. So ask for a meeting.
