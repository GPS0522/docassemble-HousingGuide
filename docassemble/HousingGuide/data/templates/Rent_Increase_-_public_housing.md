GUIDE ME: My landlord wants to raise the rent and I live in public
housing.

**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of assistance.**

*If you live in public housing, your rent is typically set based on your
household income. So if your household income changes, and you have
timely reported that change in income, you can expect a change in your
rent.*

** If you do not agree with the amount your rent was raised:**

If you do not agree that the housing authority has set the amount of
your rent correctly, you can request a meeting with your worker or
property manager to review how they calculated your rent. You may find
they have the amount of your household income wrong, and you can then
ask them to redo the calculation.

** If you did not timely report an increase of your income:**

If you did not timely report an increase in your income, the housing
authority can change your rent retroactively. If this is your situation,
you should request a meeting to set-up a payment plan.
