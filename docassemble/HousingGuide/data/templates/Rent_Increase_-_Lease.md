GUIDE ME: My landlord wants to raise the rent and I have a lease.

**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of assistance.**

*Your landlord typically cannot raise the rent during the term of your
lease. The only time it can be raised during the term is when there is a
lease clause that allows for an increase during the term. This is not
common.*

** Check your lease to see if it will automatically renew with
a rent increase**:

Sometimes when a lease automatically renews it will also raise the rent
going forward. This is also not common. If this is your situation, check
the lease to see what you need to do to cancel any renewal.

** My lease has ended. Can my landlord just raise the rent?**

No. You must agree to the rent increase before a landlord can start
charging you the rent increase.

**Watch Out**: *The moment you start paying the higher rent -- even if
you never signed anything -- you have accepted the rent increase and are
stuck paying it*. However, until you agree to pay the increase, you are
not required to pay the higher rent.

** I don't want to pay the rent increase. What should I do?**

1.  Don't sign anything that says you agree to the rent increase.

2.  Tell the landlord clearly and in writing that you do not accept the
    rent increase.

3.  Continue to pay the rent you had been paying.

4.  Do not pay the rent increase. *The moment you start paying the
    higher rent -- even if you never signed anything -- you have
    accepted the rent increase and are stuck paying it*.

5.  Negotiate a smaller rent increase. If you are willing to pay a
    smaller rent increase, ask your landlord if he will accept a lesser
    increase. Some landlords may agree.

Frequently Asked Questions:

**1. Is there any limit on how much a landlord can raise the rent**?

No. Landlords can set rent at whatever amount they think they can get
tenants to pay, not what you can afford. However, a landlord cannot
raise the rent as a way to retaliate against you. If your landlord asks
for a rent increase within 6 months of you reporting bad conditions in
writing to the landlord or within 6 months of you reporting code
violations, the rent increase could be considered
retaliation. Learn more about what to do if you think your
landlord is retaliating against you here:

**2. What will happen if I don't accept the rent increase?**

When you don't accept a rent increase, it means you no longer have an
agreement with the landlord on the continuation of your tenancy. At this
point a landlord could ask you to leave. If you don't leave voluntarily
a landlord could begin an eviction case against. But the landlord would
first have to send you a notice to quit. However, as long as you
continue to pay your existing rent, the landlord can not evict you for
non payment of rent or the amount the landlord wanted as an increase.
When evictions are brought because a tenant refused to pay a rent
increase, tenants typically can get additional time to move.
