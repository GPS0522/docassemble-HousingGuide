GUIDE ME: My landlord wants to evict me and I made an agreement with my
landlord that I have not been able to keep.

**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of assistance.**

** File a Motion To Amend Agreement**:

If you are having trouble keeping your agreement, you may try to
renegotiate the agreement by filing a Motion to Amend Agreement.

** Talk to Your Landlord:**

Some landlords may be willing to renegotiate the terms of your
agreement. If your landlord is willing to do this, you should still file
a Motion to Amend Agreement. At the hearing date, you can have your new
agreement replace the old one. This way, it will be enforced the same
way as the prior agreement.
