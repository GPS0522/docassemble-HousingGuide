GUIDE ME: I live in subsidized or public housing and I don't think I am
paying the right rent and my worker or property manager has sent me a
notice stating my new rent and I don't think it is correct.

**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of assistance.**

** If You Live in Public Housing or Have a Mobile Section 8
Voucher:**

Ask for a meeting with your worker or property manager. If you live in
public housing or have a mobile Section 8 voucher, you have the right to
request an informal hearing or grievance if you think your rent is
wrong. This should have been stated in your rent change notice.

** If You Live in Private Subsidized Housing:**

Ask for a meeting with your worker or property manager. If you live in
private subsidized housing, you do not have a right to a hearing or
grievance but the landlord is still required to consult with you if you
think a mistake has been made. So ask for a meeting.
