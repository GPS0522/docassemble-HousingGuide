GUIDE ME: I'm having problems with my neighbors.

**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of
assistance.**



** Talk to your neighbor:**
-------------------------------------------------

If you feel safe, talk to your neighbor about the problem. Simply
speaking to your neighbor may help. Sometimes neighbors do not have any
idea they are bothering you.

** Ask your landlord for help in writing:**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you and your neighbor have the same landlord, you can ask your
landlord for help. Under the law, your landlord has a duty to protect
you from unreasonable disturbances (the law calls this the right to
"Quiet Enjoyment").

When making a complaint with your landlord:

1.  Explain the problem in writing.

2.  Include the dates and times your neighbor made it impossible for
    > you to feel at home.

3.  Describe your neighbor's actions.

4.  Tell your landlord you need them to do something about the
    > problem.

5.  Remind your landlord that if they do not take care of the problem,
    > they could be "in breach of your right to Quiet Enjoyment" and
    > this is breaking the law.

6.  Keep copies of everything you send your landlord.



** Has your neighbor committed a crime? Call the police:**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calling the police creates a record which can later be very useful to
you or your landlord if this disturbance somehow becomes part of a court
case like an eviction or restraining order.

If your neighbor has robbed you or attacked you, report the crime to
the police immediately.

Some conduct is less obviously a crime. For example, making too much
noise can also be a crime. Some cities and towns have local laws, called
ordinances, that outlaw certain levels or types of noise at different
times of the day. The police can enforce these local laws
too.

** Go to Court:**



If your landlord refuses to take action to stop the disturbances after
you have complained, you might be able to get an order from a court
telling your landlord to do something to stop the
disturbance.

If your neighbor's conduct is really bad, you might be able to get a
restraining order against them. You can get a restraining order from
your local Housing Court. Most courts have forms that you can fill
out.
