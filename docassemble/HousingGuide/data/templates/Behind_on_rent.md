** Make A Payment Plan With Your Landlord:**



It is recommended that you start working on a plan with your landlord
as soon as possible. Ask your landlord if they will make a payment plan
without going to court.



** Go to Court Even If You Think You Have Worked It Out With
Your Landlord:**



If your landlord started an eviction case against you in court, make
sure to attend court on your hearing date -- even if you think you have
worked it out with your landlord or paid off your back rent. The
landlord could ask for a default judgment against you if you don't
show-up.



** Contact local charities or religious organizations to ask
if they have any services that may help.**
