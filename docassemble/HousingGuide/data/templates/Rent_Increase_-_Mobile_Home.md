GUIDE ME: My landlord wants to raise the rent and I live in a mobile
home park.

**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of assistance.**

***Do you live in a town with rent control?***

*If you live in one of these towns, a mobile home park must seek
permission from the town's rent control agency before it can raise the
rent:*

  *Belchertown*   *Bernardston*        *Boston*
  --------------- -------------------- -----------------
  *Brookfield*    *Cheshire*           *Chicopee*
  *Dalton*        *Merrimac*           *Ludlow*
  *Middleboro*    *North Adams*        *North Reading*
  *Orange*        *Palmer*             *Peabody*
  *Pittsfield*    *Raynham*            *Rockland*
  *Salisbury*     *Springfield*        *Wales*
  *Warren*        *West Bridgewater*   

*To find out how rent control works, you can contact your local town or
city hall to get a copy of the rent control regulation.*

** No Local Rent Control:**

If there is no mobile home rent control where you live, the park owner
can charge any rent they want. A park owner may increase your rent only
if:

1.  All other park tenants get the same rent increase, and

2.  The park owner sends park tenants a rent increase notice that says
    that the tenancy ends in 30 days, and what the new rent amount will
    be.

** Illegal Rent Increases:**

The rent increase is illegal if:

* The landlord violates the rent control ordinance (if you live in a
    town with rent control).

* The park owner does not give you correct written notice.

* The rent increase is based on a park rule that is unreasonable or
    unfair.

*If you suspect that the rent increase is illegal, you can call the
Attorney General's Consumer Complaint Division for help (617) 727-8400.*
