GUIDE ME: My landlord wants to raise the rent and I live in Section 8 or
MRVP housing and I do have a mobile voucher.

**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of assistance.**

*If you have a mobile subsidy, the landlord cannot raise the rent
without first getting approval from the housing authority that
administers the subsidy.*

If your landlord insists you sign something without first getting
approval from the housing authority, contact your worker and ask for
their help.

Never start paying the rent increase -- even if you agree to it, without
getting approval from your housing authority worker. Doing so could get
both you and your landlord in trouble with the housing authority.

Even if you agree to the rent increase, your housing authority worker
needs to do the following before a rent increase can go into effect

1.  Your worker will review the fairness of the increase for you.

2.  Your worker will tell you how the rent increase will change what you
    pay for rent.
