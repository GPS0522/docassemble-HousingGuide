** Talk to your landlord:**

Some landlords may be willing to resolve the issues without going to
court. If your landlord needs you to move because he is taking the unit
off the rental market, you may be able to negotiate an extension of time
to leave and avoid having to go to court.

GUIDE ME: My landlord wants to evict me and I have received a letter or
notice telling me to leave.



**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of
assistance.**



* This is the first step in the eviction process. You do not need to
leave by the date stated in the notice. Your landlord can only start an
eviction case against you after the date you are told to leave has
passed.*



** Educate yourself about your rights and
options:**



Use this time to educate yourself about your rights and options. If you
received a notice to quit for nonpayment of rent, you have the right to
pay what you owe and stop the landlord from starting an eviction case in
court.



Depending on the reason why the landlord has served you with a notice
to quit, you may have defenses and counterclaims that you can raise in
an Answer after the court eviction case has begun. Learn more about ways
to stop or delay an eviction at:
www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-booklet-6-removing-default.pdf(http://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-booklet-6-removing-default.pdf).



** Talk to your landlord:**



Some landlords may be willing to resolve the issues underlying the
notice to quit without going to court. If your eviction is because you
owe rent, some landlords will still make a payment plan and let you stay
as long as you can get caught up on your rent. Even if a landlord is not
interested in letting you stay long term, many landlords will agree to
give you a reasonable amount of time to move on your own because the
landlord has to pay more money to have you forcibly evicted.

GUIDE ME: My landlord wants to evict me and I have received a summons
telling me about a court date.



**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of
assistance.**



*This is your court date. It is really important that you show-up for
court -- even if you think you have worked everything out with your
landlord. If you do not show-up, the landlord can request a default
judgment against you.*



** File an Answer:**



An Answer is a legal form completed by you that explains why you should
not be evicted. In other words, it contains your defense to the
eviction. If you are being evicted for non payment of rent or are being
evicted without fault attributed to you, you can also bring
counterclaims against your landlord for things the landlord did wrong.
At the bottom of your eviction summons and complaint, it states the date
you must file an Answer with the court. A copy must also be served on
the landlord (or their lawyer) by this same date. Learn more about
preparing an Answer at
www.masslegalhelpf.org/housing/lt1-booklet-3-answer.pdf(http://www.masslegalhelpf.org/housing/lt1-booklet-3-answer.pdf).
Or, use MADE to electronically create an Answer for you,

** Serve a Demand for Discovery:**



Discovery refers to the process by which parties to a court case can
request information from the other side in order to better prepare for
trial. In eviction cases, it usually takes the form of a list of
questions (called interrogatories) and a Request for Documents. You have
the right to serve a Demand for Discovery on your landlord by the same
date as the Answer due date. If you timely serve your Demand for
Discovery, your hearing date will be postponed for two weeks. Learn more
about serving discovery at
www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/evcition-nanswer-interview(http://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/evcition-nanswer-interview).



** File a Notice of Transfer to Housing Court:**



If your landlord filed the eviction case in a District Court, you have
the right to transfer the case to the Housing Court. This is recommended
because the Housing Court has more resources to help tenants who are
representing themselves. Learn more about requesting a Transfer at
www.masslegalhelpf.org/housing/lt1-booklet-5-transfer.pdf

GUIDE ME: My landlord wants to evict me and I had a hearing before a
judge and I lost and I have been served with a notice of scheduled
eviction.



**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of
assistance.**



*This means that a judgment for possession (eviction) and, if you owed
rent, for damages has entered against you. It will also state that you
have to pay the landlord's court costs and interest that has come due on
any unpaid rent.*



* This also means that the landlord has gotten an execution from the
court, has now hired the county sheriff or a constable to forcibly
remove you from the apartment if you don't leave on your own. Before a
sheriff or constable can evict you, however, they must give you a
written notice of the date and time you will be evicted, and this notice
must be served on you at least 48 hours before the date of your
eviction.*



** File a Motion To Stop Physical Eviction**:\


Even after you have been served with a notice of physical eviction, you
still might be able to get the court to stop or postpone a scheduled
eviction. These stays are hard to get and are usually only granted when
you have an emergency or can show that the landlord will not be harmed
by granting a postponement of your eviction.



** Talk to Your Landlord:**



Even after you lose your eviction case, many landlords are still
willing to negotiate an agreement with you. If your eviction is because
you owe rent, some landlords will still make a payment plan and let you
stay as long as you can get caught up on your rent. Even if a landlord
is not interested in letting you stay long term, many landlords will
agree to give you a reasonable amount of time to move on your own
because the landlord has to pay more money to have you forcibly
evicted.

GUIDE ME: My landlord wants to evict me and I had a hearing before a
judge and lost and I have not been served with a notice of scheduled
eviction.



**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of
assistance.**



*This means that a judgment for possession (eviction) and, if you owed
rent, for damages has been entered against you. It will also state that
you have to pay the landlord's court costs and interest that has come
due on any unpaid rent.*



*Eleven days after the date of the judgment, the landlord can request
an Execution from the court. This is the legal document a landlord needs
to schedule a date to have you physically evicted if you do not leave on
your own.*



** File an Appeal:**



You can file an Appeal, but you only have 10 days from the date of the
judgment to do this.



** Seek a Stay of the Execution:**

 

You can file a motion seeking a stay of execution. If the court grants
a stay of the execution it means the landlord cannot move forward with
physically evicting you until the stay ends or is lifted. Learn more
about how to file a Stay here:

GUIDE ME: My landlord wants to evict me, I made an agreement with my
landlord, and my landlord has served me with a motion that I am in
violation of my agreement.



**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of
assistance.**



** Show-Up for the Motion Hearing:**



Don't ignore this motion -- even if you have broken the agreement. At
the hearing, the judge will give you a chance to explain what happened.
You may be able to get the judge to agree to overlook the violation or
you may be able to show that you can continue to comply with the
agreement going forward. Sometimes landlords will agree to renegotiate
the agreement if you have a reasonable explanation or plan for
continuing to comply with the agreement.



** File a Motion To Amend Agreement:**



If there is time, file your own motion to amend the agreement. If you
are having trouble keeping your agreement, you can try to get the
landlord to agree to change the agreement. To get your landlord back to
court to renegotiate your agreement, file a Motion to Amend
Agreement.

GUIDE ME: My landlord wants to evict me and I made an agreement with my
landlord that I have not been able to keep.



**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of
assistance.**



** File a Motion To Amend Agreement**:



If you are having trouble keeping your agreement, you may try to
renegotiate the agreement by filing a Motion to Amend
Agreement.



** Talk to Your Landlord:**



Some landlords may be willing to renegotiate the terms of your
agreement. If your landlord is willing to do this, you should still file
a Motion to Amend Agreement. At the hearing date, you can have your new
agreement replace the old one. This way, it will be enforced the same
way as the prior agreement.

GUIDE ME: My landlord wants to evict me and I missed my court date and
was defaulted and I have now been served with a Notice of Scheduled
Eviction.



**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of
assistance.**



** File a Motion To Stop Physical Eviction**:

** File a Motion to Remove Default:**



You can file a Motion to Remove Default Judgment. Learn more about
filing this motion at
www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/lt1-booklet-6-removing-default.pdf. If the
court grants your motion to remove default, the judgement that had been
entered gets canceled and you go back to where the case
started.

eviction.



**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of

*If you do not show up for a court hearing, a landlord has the option
of defaulting you as long as you are not in active military service.
This means the landlord got a judgment for possession (eviction) and, if
you owe rent, damages in the amount of the rent the landlord claims you
owe. If you do nothing to remove the default, eleven days from the date
of the default the landlord can request an execution and after that hire
a county sheriff or constable to evict you.*
