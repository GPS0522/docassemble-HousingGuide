GUIDE ME: My landlord wants to evict me, I made an agreement with my
landlord, and my landlord has served me with a motion that I am in
violation of my agreement.

**Below are some steps you can take.  Depending on your
situation, one or more of these steps may be of assistance.**

** Show-Up for the Motion Hearing:**

Don't ignore this motion -- even if you have broken the agreement. At
the hearing, the judge will give you a chance to explain what happened.
You may be able to get the judge to agree to overlook the violation or
you may be able to show that you can continue to comply with the
agreement going forward. Sometimes landlords will agree to renegotiate
the agreement if you have a reasonable explanation or plan for
continuing to comply with the agreement.

** File a Motion To Amend Agreement:**

If there is time, file your own motion to amend the agreement. If you
are having trouble keeping your agreement, you can try to get the
landlord to agree to change the agreement. To get your landlord back to
court to renegotiate your agreement, file a Motion to Amend Agreement.
